**PHK** is a full-featured package system for PHP developers.

Basically, it is a PHP-oriented equivalent of the Java *jar* format. Like *jar*, **PHK** allows to distribute and run a library or an application as a single file.

**PHK** also 
provides a lot of high-level features such as an integrated autoloader, integrated unit tests, support for meta-packages, CRC checks, digital signatures...
