This directory is an example of documentation packages (Zend Framework documentation). While PHK packages generally contain programs and libraries, they may also be used to gather a tree of static content, like a documentation tree.

The main benefits are :

* It is much easier to manage a single file than a huge file tree.
* File integrity is guaranteed.
* No need to care about file/directory access rights
* Integrated compression reduces the stored size.

The drawback is that documentation packages can only be displayed through a web server.

The packages generated by this example are available online :

* [Zend Framework 2 API Documentation](http://phk.tekwire.net/demo/zfw_doc_api.phk.php/index.html)
* [Programmerâ€™s Reference Guide of Zend Framework 2](http://phk.tekwire.net/demo/zfw_doc_man.phk.php)
