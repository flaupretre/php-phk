This is a (totally useless) minimal package.

It just displays a small message to indicate how it was loaded.

Use it to experiment, add files, options...

Suggestion/exercise: After having built 'mini.phk', use it as a subpackage in another example (a package embedded in another package). Repeat after adding a class to mini.phk, and check how the autoloader transparently finds it from the first-level code.
