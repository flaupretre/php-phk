<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is the welcome screen of the PHK <i>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tekwire.net/joomla/products/phk/manual.htm#webinfo">
webinfo</a></i> mode. This page is displayed <u><i>by the package file</i></u> 
running in a special 'display' mode, called <i>webinfo</i> mode. This  is an integral part of every PHK package 
file and probably one of the coolest feature of the PHK software. For more 
information about the <i>webinfo</i> mode and the way to switch it on/off,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tekwire.net/joomla/products/phk/manual.htm#webinfo">
please consult the PHK documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Using the tabs on the top of the page, you can display 
 
the package's documentation, license, the content of each 
file contained herein, the Autoload map... Feel free to navigate in 
these screens, you cannot modify or break anything from these pages.</p>
<h3>What does this package contain ?</h3>
<p>This package contains the <i>core library</i> part of the Zend Framework 
Version 1.0.1.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that :</p>
<ul>
  <li>although fully functional, this package is a demo 
package and must be considered more as a proof of concept, than as a 
production-grade library</li>
  <li>this package is not 
validated nor supported by the Zend Framework Development team.</li>
  <li>some of the unit tests fail because they were not made compatible with the 
  PHK architecture.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to use it</h3>
<p>1. Ensure you have :</p>
<ul>
  <li>PHP version 5.1.0 or more</li>
  <li>the <i>zlib</i> and <i>iconv</i> extensions loaded or available via <i>dl()</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.

'Zend Framework Core library' package</a></p>
<p>3. Save the file in your include path.</p>
<p>4. The only thing you need to change in your source files is that you won't <i>include</i>/<i>require</i> 
any of 
the framework files any more: they are automagically loaded when you use the 
corresponding Zend classes or interfaces. Everywhere you have something like '<i>require_once 
'Zend/.../.../&lt;something&gt;.php</i>', just remove or comment out these 
directives. If you use the <i>Loader</i> class, you don't have to change 
anything as this 
class is modified to be compatible with Automap.</p>
<p>5. Instead of the previous include directives, you will just have to <i>
include</i> or <i>require</i> the package file once. Don't worry, it has a
'<i>.phk</i>' extension but it can be included as any other PHP source file. As soon 
as the package file has been included, you can use every class of the 
Framework without having to explicitely include or load anything else. Of 
course, the package needs to be included only once per PHP invocation, generally 
in the main script.</p>
<p>6. That's all. Now, enjoy the powerful features of the 
Zend Framework
