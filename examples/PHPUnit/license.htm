<h1>The BSD License</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>The following is a BSD license template. To generate your own license, 
  change the values of OWNER, ORGANIZATION and YEAR from their original values 
  as given here, and substitute your own.</p>
  <p><em>Note</em>: The advertising clause in the license appearing on BSD Unix 
  files was officially
  <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change">
  rescinded</a> by the Director of the Office of Technology Licensing of the 
  University of California on July 22 1999. He states that clause 3 is &quot;hereby 
  deleted in its entirety.&quot;</p>
  <p>Note the new BSD license is thus equivalent to the
  <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT License</a>, 
  except for the no-endorsement final clause.</p>
